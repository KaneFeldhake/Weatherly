# Weatherly :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain:	
### Weatherly is a Android-based mobile application developed using Android Studio w/ Java. It contains a very elegant and simple-to-use UI that renders real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMapAPI. The app gets user's location via GoogleMapsAPI.

The app was designed to expand my knowledge on the use of :
  - API's (Google Maps and OpenWeatherAPI)
  - UI/UX
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Gathering information about a user
  - Virtual Environments (Android Emulators)
  - XML
  - And more...


Upcoming Features:
  - Store extra locations
  - Menu that allows changing to stored locations
  - Dynamic Background Conditions (based on current weather)
