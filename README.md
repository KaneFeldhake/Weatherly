# Weatherly :cloud_with_lightning_and_rain:	
### Weatherly is a Android-based mobile application developed using Android Studio w/ Java. It contains a very elegant and simple-to-use UI that renders real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMapAPI. The app gets user's location via GoogleMapsAPI.

The app was designed to expand my knowledge on the use of :
  - API's (Google Maps and OpenWeatherAPI)
  - UI/UX
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Gathering information about a user
  - Virtual Environments (Android Emulators)
  - XML
  - And more...


Upcoming Features:
  - Store extra locations
  - Menu that allows changing to stored locations
  - Dynamic Background Conditions (based on current weather)


## How to Use
Since projects that are developed on Android Studio are emulator based, it makes running the project difficult. The emulator in Android Studio set its default location to somewhere that is not the user location automatically. With some adjustment, the user can work around this by changing individual location settings locally. Because of this issue, I have provided screenshots of the app.
